## UX
Realization of this project depends on the availability of users and technologies. Users would be public bus commuters or individual who has lost his/her way at some unfamiliar places. This application should fulfill their following needs:

- "I want to find the nearest bus stop from my location within a walkable distance."
- "I want to find the bus stop which I need to alight."
- "I want to find a particular bus stop."
- "I want to know where is the bus now."
- "I want to know my current location."
- "I want to know when is the bus going to arrival."
- "I want to know what are the bus services available at the bus stop."
- "I want to know the name of the street or road or bus stop code."

By using front-end and back-end technologies such as bootstrap,  restful api, the user's needs can be achieved. This application would present a landing page of a singapore map with clickable buttons and text boxes for user's inputs. It would provides user on the location of the bus, bus stop and user, as well as real-time information of a bus stop and bus.  A wireframe of this application can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/fbc25fb5-8cc7-4cdf-afc6-19bc692072b8-ae91/).

### Bugs/Problems Encountered
There are a numbers of bugs or problems encountered during the development of the project. The main ones are as explained below:

- ***Retriving data after looping through a pymongo.cursor.Cursor object*** <br>
During looping of movie database on the html side using Jinja2 language, the looping can only be looped once. It was discovered that the return type of the movie database was a pymongo cursor which resulted only a single scan in the loop. 
This was solved by changing the type from pymongo cursor to list object on the server side before passing it to the html.

- ***Reading same file*** <br>
During uploading of the image file to the Cloudinary cloud database, the Cloudinary api responded with an error on empty file being uploaded.
It was discovered that after performing a read operation on the file in the form validation function, the pointer of the file was shifted to the end
of the file. Hence, this caused Cloudinary to detect an [empty image file](stackoverflow.com/questions/28320658/python-why-a-file-is-empty-after-reading-it-and-writing-to-another-one). This was solved by shifting the file pointer to the start of the file using 
[seek](https://www.codestudyblog.com/questions/sf/0421194141.html) and then read the file again.
